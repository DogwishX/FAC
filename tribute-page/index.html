        <h2>Making History</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Katsushika Hokusai</strong> (葛飾 北斎, 31 October 1760 – 10
          May 1849), known simply as <strong>Hokusai</strong>, was a Japanese
          artist, ukiyo-e painter and printmaker of the Edo period.
          <strong>Hokusai</strong> is best known for the woodblock print series
          <strong>Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji</strong> which includes the
          internationally iconic print
          <strong>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</strong>.

          />
        </div>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Hokusai's</strong> date of birth is unclear, but is often
          stated as the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the Hōreki
          era to an artisan family, in the
          <strong>Katsushika district of Edo</strong>. His childhood name was
          <strong>Tokitarō</strong>. It is believed his father was
          <strong>Nakajima Ise</strong>, a mirror-maker for the shōgun. His
          father never made Hokusai an heir, so it is possible that his mother
          was a concubine. <strong>Hokusai</strong> began painting around the
          age of six, perhaps learning from his father, whose work included the
          painting of designs around mirrors.

        </div>
        <h2>Middle Period</h2>
        <p>
          The next period saw <strong>Hokusai's</strong> association with the
          <strong>Tawaraya School</strong> and the adoption of the name
          <strong>"Tawaraya Sōri"</strong>. He produced many privately
          commissioned prints for special occasions <em>(surimono)</em>, and
          illustrations for books of humorous poems <em>(kyōka ehon)</em> during
          this time. In 1798, <strong>Hokusai</strong> passed his name on to a
          pupil and set out as an independent artist, free from ties to a school
          for the first time, adopting the name <strong>Hokusai Tomisa</strong>.

        <h2>Later Life</h2>
        <p>
          The next period, beginning in 1834, saw
          <strong>Hokusai</strong> working under the name "<strong
            >Gakyō Rōjin</strong
          >" <em>(画狂老人; "The Old Man Mad About Art")</em>. It was at this
          time that he produced
          <strong>One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji</strong>, another significant
          series, generally considered "the masterpiece among his landscape
          picture books".
