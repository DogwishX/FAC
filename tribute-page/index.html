          <strong>Katsushika Hokusai</strong> (葛飾 北斎, c. 31 October 1760 –
          10 May 1849), known simply as <strong>Hokusai</strong>, was a Japanese
          artist, ukiyo-e painter and printmaker of the Edo period.
          <strong>Hokusai</strong> is best known for the woodblock print series
          <strong>Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji</strong> which includes the
          internationally iconic print
          <strong>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</strong>.

        <p class="early-life__text">
          <strong>Hokusai's</strong> date of birth is unclear, but is often
          stated as the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the Hōreki
          era to an artisan family, in the
          <strong>Katsushika district of Edo</strong>. His childhood name was
          <strong>Tokitarō</strong>. It is believed his father was
          <strong>Nakajima Ise</strong>, a mirror-maker for the shōgun. His
          father never made Hokusai an heir, so it is possible that his mother
          was a concubine. <strong>Hokusai</strong> began painting around the
          age of six, perhaps learning from his father, whose work included the
          painting of designs around mirrors.
